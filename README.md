# ScoreKeeper


Two players player 1  and player 2 .When the page is loaded it displays that we're playing to five.
So all we do is add a point by clicking on a button.
So to add a point to player 1 we click on Player 1, if we want to add a point to player 2 click on Player2 and then whoever gets to five wins the game.
And if we try to score again, we can't.That's because the game is over.
We can reset by clicking the reset button.One more feature is that we can also specify what we're playing to.
