# ScoreKeeper


Two players player 1 score and player 2 score.You load up the page and it tells us that we're playing to five.

So all we do is add a point by clicking on a button.

So to add a point to player 1 we click on Player 1 if we want to add a point player to click on Player
2 and then whoever gets to five,you notice it turns green.

And if we try to score again we can't.That's because the game is over.

So I can reset by clicking the reset button.

So one more feature is that we can also specify what we're playing to.
